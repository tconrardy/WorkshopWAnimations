          <h2> Introduction</h2>
          <p> With constantly-changing expectations surrounding social distancing and prevention measures against COVID-19, the majority of educational institutions have shifted their efforts to remote learning. With 37 states recommending school campus closures throughout the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year, at least 124,000 public and private schools and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures.html">at least 55.1 million students have been impacted by the shift to remote learning.</a> During virtual school, however, many schools have faced challenges in shifting their curricula online and issues of accessibility — both pedagogical and technological. Accessibility can be viewed in terms of educators’ and students’ access to technological resources, such as devices and WiFi. They can also be viewed in terms of how educators approach both teaching and learning, especially for students with special needs.</p>
          <p>My older sister,  Lydia, who has nonverbal autism, is still developing a method of learning through virtual school. As she is unable to communicate through verbal or written speech, virtual schooling does not provide her with nearly the same level of focus or relationships that in-person school does. Because she is enrolled in what is essentially a vocational training program, she doesn’t have the opportunity to practice the real-life skills she will need once she ages out of school. Although my family is happy to run a home program, we’re aware of the fact that not all of the mandated services in her Individualized Education Plan (IEP) may be delivered under the current system, and it is highly unlikely that she will meet the goals in her IEP for this term. However, her teachers have worked closely with my parents and Lydia, hand-delivering low-tech communication sheets and making individualized videos to guide our home-based instruction. As a family, we acknowledge that we are very privileged in the sense that we are able to care for and support Lydia at home. And because we’ve already planned for Lydia to continue living at home once she completes her schooling, we don’t have a sense of urgency around meeting this term’s IEP goals that might lead to a future job and income. These schools and programs in the Manchester area seem to be doing an effective job of delivering services to their students with special needs, and if independent schools are genuinely meant to be private schools with a public purpose, this is a time when their systems and expertise might be shared with the public school system.</p>
          <p>Especially in such a rural area, both students and teachers in Vermont have worked with schools to access the technological resources needed for virtual schooling. A teacher at one of the schools in my area does not have internet access in her own home to host remote learning. Instead, she has been given the keys to her local bar with WiFi and commutes there every day to teach her students. At Maple Street School, there are multiple teachers each day working at the school itself —  while keeping in mind physical distancing — because it is the only place they have access to the internet. The only reason they are able to do this, however, is because each of their individual classrooms has its own door to the outside, so they are able to come and go through their personal entrance, not sharing any common spaces such as hallways, bathrooms, or even door handles. Many students, particularly those in low-income and rural areas, face similar challenges and are unable to receive the same education as their peers. </p>
          <p>Through three sections — Transition From On-Campus to Remote Learning, Addressing Accessibility and Technology, and Approaching Special Education and Remote Learning — I aim to investigate how different educational communities in Vermont have approached remote learning, particularly through the lens of accessibility. With these students, teachers, and families at the forefront of the wide-ranging experiment in education our country is currently undergoing, I hope to provide a microanalysis of schooling that may also offer insights into broader educational issues. This educational community in Vermont — everyone from my sister at home to the teachers working tirelessly to care and provide for their students — has demonstrated a strong sense of optimism amidst the deeper educational issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am hopeful that this turning point in history can serve as an opportunity to address issues of accessibility in education, public and private schools working together to make education systems more equitable and accessible for our post-pandemic society.</p>

        <div class="regular">
          <h2> Part 1 — Transition From On-Campus to Remote Learning </h2>
          <blockquote><i>"School is a wonderful equalizer: the same teachers, the same classrooms, the same facilities, the same school for all. Once you go online, everyone’s ‘classroom’ is different, with some having a very good setting for learning, and others surrounded by distractions, dysfunction, not to mention spotty Internet service.” </i><br>
            – Mark Tashjian, Headmaster of Burr and Burton Academy</blockquote>
          <p>Maple Street School, an independent K-8, began preparing for a possible shutdown weeks prior to its occurrence. Preparing students, faculty, and staff with training on technology, each department had weeks to adapt their curricula to an online platform. They also developed a hybrid model for virtual schooling, with the consultation of Nicholas Christakis, an epidemiologist at Yale University.</p>
          <p>Cricket Mikheev, my mother and Head of Maple Street School, worked to develop this model, allowing students the option to come to school or to stay home and video conference into classes. The model ran for a week before the Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott, ordered all schools to transition to remote learning. Dr. Mikheev said, “The original plan was designed to provide continuity and stability for students and families. Because we had launched hybrid school… teachers had already begun to understand and use a range of resources including Google Classroom, Meet, Hangout, and to familiarize themselves with the dynamics of muting and assessment from afar.”</p>
          <p>“We continue to focus primarily on the social and emotional wellbeing of students and the continuity of learning, and we are now considering ways that distance learning opens opportunities for changes in our practices. In other words, instead of morning meeting followed by worksheets and individual consultations with teachers, how can we consider our end of the year goals for students and use those to inform more competency-based learning and inquiry-driven pedagogy” she continued.</p>
          <p>Some of the schools that are a part of the BRSU (Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union) in Vermont, however, have approached virtual schooling through different methods. With the public schools having larger student populations, a higher teacher to student ratio, and fewer resources readily available, their approaches to virtual school began with less teacher-to-student interaction and are still evolving to make teaching and learning most productive. </p>
          <p>Andrea Kaplan, a parent of a sixth-grader at Manchester Elementary Middle School (MEMS), noted that her son has not had any teaching through online learning so far. While he uses learning websites such as IXL, Newesla, and Membean, calling platforms such as Zoom are provided for purposes of social interaction and other loose learning discussions. She said, “I am curious to see how MEMS develops their online learning, there is more to come after the spring break. Isolated online learning, providing no feedback is not a healthy educational setting for him.”</p>
          <p>Similarly, Jessica Dillon, a parent of children at the Dorset School, acknowledges that some programs may place heavier responsibility on parents of struggling students. “Although some students benefit from learning at their own pace, the challenges of providing so many students with the individualized learning of a classroom, will be difficult. Troubleshooting lies heavily on the parents and students,” Ms. Dillon said. Parents are playing a much heavier role in their childrens’ education now that their children are being taught under the same roof. For parents that can afford to spend the time and resources to give their children this extra attention, remote learning is usually not too much of an inconvenience. Other families, however, find themselves in a much different scenario. For families who have to work jobs out of the house, families of children with special needs, families who have limited experience with technology, or families who are unable to provide support for their children, this added component of education is not as simple.</p>
          <p>Mark Tashjian is the Headmaster of Burr and Burton Academy, a town academy for grades 9-12 educating students with a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. He emphasizes the significance of these struggles, saying, “I fear that the differences and outcome over the next couple of months will be quite substantial, with our top students roaring ahead, while struggling students will languish.” </p>
          <p>Both independent and public schools are also anxiously considering what is ahead with the emerging economic crisis. Vermont’s education fund, covering the majority of school spending, is built up of revenue from property taxes, sales and use taxes, vehicle purchase and use taxes, meals and rooms taxes, and lottery revenue. Jen Samuelson, Chair of the Winhall Board of Education, discussed that as Vermont and other states are experiencing record unemployment and a “shelter in place” mandate, all sources for the education fund, except for property taxes, are being reduced. With the fiscal year 2020 most likely ending with a deficit, increasing pressure on property taxes will impact people when they are increasingly economically vulnerable.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mikheev explained that their administration’s priority has been to serve families well and to work towards ensuring financial sustainability, considering canceled fundraisers and other anticipated challenges for many families who pay tuition. Additionally, they are finding new ways for their students to engage in problem-based learning in order for students to follow their interests and for teachers to act as instructional coaches. She says, “In terms of pedagogy, there is a concern that if we ask parents (particularly of younger students) to be deeply involved in scaffolding their child’s learning, that they may balk at paying tuition for the upcoming year if it is determined that we cannot be on campus for chunks of time,” she said. </p>
          <p>Maple Street has also addressed new issues with technology, both pedagogical and logistical. Complying with laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), given the rapid adoption of new technologies and apps, has presented an administrative challenge. Furthermore, many teachers have struggled to explore these new technologies on their own without the time for professional development rollouts.</p>
          <p>Polly Stone is both a librarian at Maple Street School and a learning specialist at Sunderland Elementary School. At Maple Street, she has ensured that components of the library curriculum are both accessible and continuing to grow. While she allowed families to borrow as many books as they could at the beginning of distance learning, the library has not been open since. In addition to providing books for families, she is also working towards identifying which products and services are most beneficial for students and teachers during remote learning. </p>
          <p>She said, “Some [companies] were clearly trying to expand their usual business model, but most were genuinely trying to be helpful.  Many authors and illustrators began having regular online read-aloud sessions, studio visits, etc., packaged curricula were making resources available for free, etc. I was receiving hundreds of emails each day, and list services were springing up among librarians all over the country that touted thousands of these resources. Weeding through these to find the ones that would actually be helpful to teachers and families at Maple Street was the biggest task I faced.” </p>
          <p>Ms. Stone has also worked towards finding resources to support teachers at Sunderland in developing their curricula for distance learning. She attends regular meetings with the teachers at Sunderland, intervention teachers throughout the districts, and her students’ teachers to identify the students’ needs. Offering daily “office hours” and synchronous learning support for struggling support, Stone’s instruction is an exception from the BRSU’s encouragement towards asynchronous learning. She says, “Unlike most of the teachers at Sunderland, my schedule has been set up to offer 1:1 synchronous learning meetings with students over a platform such as Zoom or Google Meet.”</p>
          <p>Ms. Stone’s son, a fourth-grader at Maple Street, received paper packets sent home every two weeks for students’ independent work in addition to the students’ class time online. Comparing her experiences with Maple Street to Sunderland, there are differences in how much time students are spending online with their classes. Ms. Stone says, “The BRSU has tried to manage the time that students are spending online or in front of a screen, and that time is significantly less than at Maple Street, at least in 4th grade.” Synchronous and asynchronous learning are both valuable — while I acknowledge the importance of having real-time interaction between teachers and their students, we must also consider students with different situations: different time zones, different family commitments and responsibilities, and other unforeseen challenges that may arise any time during quarantine. I’m not sure, however, the asynchronous should be used primarily to limit screen time for students. </p>
          <p>At Maple Street, students attend synchronous advising and lessons from 8:00 a.m. until 11:20 a.m., with a break from 9:35 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. This adds up to 2 hours and 55 minutes of online learning each day. This time accounts for the four primary classes: English, Math, Science, and History. Extra subjects, such as art, music, and P.E., are taught asynchronously. While the three hours of school each day doesn’t account for extra work outside of class (a lot of which is not technology-based, according to my younger sister, a student at Maple Street), the time does not nearly add up to the time used by a “regular” school day. I believe that schools should seek a balance of synchronous and asynchronous learning, their aim being to most effectively teach students during these challenging times. If higher quality learning means increased screen time, it’s worth it.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Samuelson acknowledged, however, the challenges of working at home for students and teachers alike, noting that a significant challenge for BBA teachers has been figuring out how to care for their own children while teaching online for their students. Similarly, Eliza Mikheev, my younger sister and a fifth-grader at Maple Street, discussed her own challenges as a student during remote learning. “I usually watch my dogs on the weekends. Sometimes my dad needs me to watch the dogs during my online classes, and they can be pretty loud. While this is usually okay because I’m on mute most of the time on Zoom, if I need to ask a question or I don’t understand something in class, I can’t tell my teacher because I don’t want to distract my classmates and teacher with my dogs’ noises” she said. Though this is a minor example of a simple distraction taking place, learning spaces for students differ drastically. While some students have access to a private, quiet room for both synchronous learning sessions and individualized work, many students have to share these spaces with their families and are obligated to family responsibilities throughout the day. There is no clear solution to ensure that students have equitable learning environments, but schools can work towards offering these students extra support.</p>
          <p>Outside of academic work, the BRSU has had to prepare and distribute meals to approximately 500 students (around 40% of its student population) and their families who usually receive free lunch at school. Delivering <a href="https://www.manchesterjournal.com/stories/brsus-jackie-wilson-gives-testimony-to-ed-committee,601488?">over 300 meals each day to families’ doorsteps,</a> the area covers over 450 square miles. Ms. Stone says, “At my school, the bus driver followed his route and delivered the meals, initially every day and then grouping them so they could send the food grouped into fewer trips.” This is a crucial aspect of virtual school that has not gained as much attention. The BRSU, cooks, and support staff have certainly done an efficient job of providing families with this service, allowing those who may not have access to sufficient food to maintain the same level of aid provided by their school during in-person learning. </p>

        <div class="regular">
          <h2>Part 2 — Addressing Accessibility and Technology </h2>
          <p>With different schools having different access to educational technologies, equity in this regard has been a main issue for many students and teachers. Mrs. Samuelson stated that many independent schools are facing challenges in providing younger students with technologies not offered by their normal curriculum. The local K-8 public schools face similar issues, in addition to a greater number of students without access to an internet connection, either because internet connectivity is not available where they live or because they are not able to afford it. In order to combat these issues, the BRSU has been providing the public school students with paper homework packets with weekly teacher check-ins.</p>
          <p>Ms. Stone, however, believes that providing education to students without internet access introduces the possibility of viral transmission from papers being passed through a cycle of students, families, and educators. Furthermore, the federal mandate that all students must have equal access to public school education did not allow online learning to begin until inequities among families were addressed. While the district has worked towards providing hotspots for families, most, but not all have access to an internet connection. Ms. Stone says, “Recognizing the vast differences in schedules, availability of parental computer support and bandwidth challenges of their families, the BRSU is encouraging teachers to avoid synchronous learning when possible (learning in real time, for example over Zoom or Google Meet) and opting instead for asynchronous (recorded) lessons that can be accessed at whatever time is most convenient to the families.” With most students and families now having access to the internet, more and more resources and assignments are being sent through online platforms such as Google Classroom. For students who still do not have internet access and those in Kindergarten and Pre-K, paper packets are sent and delivered.</p>
          <p>The Dorset School, on the other hand, has worked towards providing Chromebook access in addition to work packets for their students. Ms. Dillon said, “Although school packets were distributed to all the students, the varying abilities of the students to use the Chrome books will directly affect the efficiency of their accessing their education. Without the one on one teaching, provided in a classroom, many students, especially in the younger grades, will be at a great disadvantage… We’re hopeful that a more efficient, detailed curriculum is rolled out after the Spring Break. We are certainly sympathetic that we are in uncharted territory and that the school is doing its best.”</p>
          <p>Maple Street provided a survey addressing students’ and families’ access to devices and WiFi a couple of weeks before they closed their campus. They provide devices to all students in grades 3-8, and all students grades K-2 are not in need of loaners from the school. Similarly, BBA provides their students with iPads to access education online, and has worked towards ensuring that their students have access to the internet and finding hotspots for students who do not have access in their home. </p>
          <p>In addition to providing these technologies, BBA also offers a range of programs for students, including the Target and the Student Success Programs. The Target Program, offering individualized support for students, is located at a satellite campus and replicates the main campus’ curriculum. Their website states, “Any Burr and Burton student struggling to succeed in a standard, traditional secondary program or at high risk of dropping out of school is eligible to apply to the Target Program.” The Student Success Program offers similar support for first-generation, college-bound students, working to “develop college and career readiness skills, strength of character, and a sense of purpose that will propel them toward a lifetime of success.”</p>
          <p>Focusing deeply and purposefully on issues of accessibility prior to remote learning, BBA has formed a community that supports students of all backgrounds and situations. <a href="https://www.burrburton.org/academics/unique-programs">Mr. Tashjian said,</a> “Obviously, not everyone’s home is equal, and that is probably the greatest challenge throughout the world… Nonetheless, there is really no way to solve the problem of family differences. Quite simply, some students have the luck to be in a family that values, appreciates and supports education; some students do not have that good fortune.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="regular">
          <h2> Part 3 — Approaching Special Education and Remote Learning </h2>
          <p>The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) directs special education services and requires school districts to ensure equal access to learning opportunities for students with disabilities. Some school districts outside of Vermont have canceled both mainstream and special education programs during online learning with the concern that they are not able to adjust their curricula to remote learning and abide by the IDEA. The state of Vermont, however, has <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2020/04/08/remote-schooling-an-impossible-situation-for-kids-with-special-needs/">mandated that schools receiving any form of state aid, including vouchers, submit Continuity of Learning (COL) plans</a> for their students with special needs.</p>
          <p>The ACCESS (Accessing Community, Careers, and Education through Successful Self-Determination) Program is another initiative at BBA that provides students with support for their academic and practical skills. These students, including those with Autism, Intellectual Disability, Attention Deficit- Hyperactivity Disorder, Angelman's Syndrome, Down's Syndrome, Specific Learning Disability, and Speech Language Impairment, have also transitioned to remote learning.</p>
          <p>Kathy Boudreau, one of the ACCESS program’s special educators, works alongside ten paraprofessionals, one speech pathologist, one OT, and two professionals. She acknowledges that their biggest challenge has become figuring out how to make learning interactive, especially for their four students without speech. Mrs. Boudreau says, “A good analogy is trying to figure out how to play a low tech board game online with only one person having the materials and the other person not able to verbally indicate their next move.”</p>
          <p>With many students needing one-on-one support, the staff has prepared individualized plans, materials, and contents for each student, aiming towards maximal productive independent work. Considering the differing levels of academic and technical support each ACCESS student has at home, the staff has worked towards creating frameworks that would not rely upon much change for the students. “As our students struggle to learn, we are very thoughtful about what and how we ask them to learn. As things happened, we had three days to implement whatever plan we developed. This was a big challenge. We spent a full three days wrapping our heads around the ‘how’ and only began to consider the ‘what’ once we actually launched our plan,” Mrs. Boudreau said. </p>
          <p>This is no small feat; with limited time to prepare such individualized plans for each student, this team has done an incredible job of working together to offer remote learning for students with special needs. Addressing crucial questions and facing these significant challenges firsthand, the ACCESS program should serve as an example for other mainstream and special needs programs.</p>
          <p>Benefiting from consistent and predictable routines, students have also received materials presented in visually simple formats clearly indicating their tasks. As ACCESS is a part of BBA, all students have access to school iPads. Google Meets is used to present content and continue the relationships between students and the staff. While binders with work were prepared for students, Mrs. Boudreau and her team “knew these would be ineffective as our students require a high level of engagement.” </p>
          <p>For impulsive learners, or those who face challenges with attention, the online math and language arts program used allows them to “think aloud.” As teachers present the content, the students dictate their desired answer to input to the teacher. For more direct instruction, Notability, an app for note-taking and annotation, is used as a dynamic tool for students. “I can put low tech communication boards into Notability and easily indicate a word I want to model for students. Notability is helpful for teaching math as students can watch in real time,” said Mrs. Boudreau.</p>
          <p>In terms of interactions between the BRSU and the ACCESS program, a Distance Learning Plan (DLP) had been mailed out for all special educators in the BRSU to complete. The BRSU, however, has not had any direct interactions or support with the ACCESS program, according to Boudreau. Students do receive support, though. Each student has a Local Educational Advocate from the BRSU. Joining meetings to ensure student needs are met, he has worked closely with the ACCESS staff and is aware of the program’s launched and successful DLP.</p>
          <p>Along with the ACCESS program’s tangible achievements, I believe we should also pay attention to and emphasize their ethic and mindset. Though they have resources that many special needs programs do not, the team — adults and students alike — have demonstrated that where there's willpower, there’s a way. These times and circumstances are unprecedented, and certain issues are inevitable. With these challenges, however, ACCESS students have received equitable access to technologies, resources, and education. This determination and perseverance are the things we all need to cultivate as the future of virtual schooling continues to unfold.</p>
