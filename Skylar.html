            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>This collection of oral histories showcases the journeys, virtual and physical, of nine Phillips Academy international students hailing from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, Bahrain, Kenya, South Africa, Lithuania and Brazil. Most if not all international students were faced with the question of whether or not to return home, a decision complicated by border closures and travel bans. As everyone finds their way to a place to stay in the days leading up to a quasi-global quarantine, every one of them has a different story to tell, especially since each country is handling the situation differently.</p>
            <p>In this collection, you will get to know some ways in which international students were affected by COVID-19, especially how travel restrictions made it difficult to return home. You will also hear their observations of the crisis under a comparative, global lens, and get a sense of the things they are most concerned about at this time of crisis.</p>
            <p>For ease of interpretation, I have included a formal timeline of significant events mentioned by these international students, as well as a timeline of Andover’s post-spring break plans, which have been revised threefold.</p>

              <p>Citing the emergence of invisible borders during quarantine, Ralph expresses concern for the homeless community around the world, who are often composed of demographics susceptible to COVID-19 yet don’t have the means to protect themselves from the virus. He also recalls the experience of having a cold at the start of March and wearing a mask in the crowded school cafeteria.<br><br>

              <p>Laura was very aware of herself coughing as an Asian while going to a grocery store, even though it was just a cold, even though no one really said anything or did anything. Laura originally planned to spend the second half of spring break with friends in San Francisco, but ended up flying home, wearing a neck scarf temporarily before getting a mask from a flight attendant. She recounts the moment she learned from her mother that someone in her workplace building had caught COVID-19.<br><br>

              <p>Koki is among the many affected by March SAT cancellations, as well as canceled college visits and hotel stays for which there was no flexible refund. She feels lucky to have returned home safely, aboard somewhat empty flights, including a double-decked A380 that was not even half full. She also raises concern for the overall strain that COVID-19 is putting on India, as wealth inequality dictates susceptibility to the virus and resources are being depleted.<br><br>

              <p>Cheryl debated the pros and cons of returning home before deciding that seeing her family and friends was worth the risk of having difficulty returning to the US. During her first few days back home, she visited friends as well as her middle school. Everything seemed like it would return to normal, like the scheduled return of her brother’s school. As the cases climbed, no one is visiting friends anymore, her middle school has closed, and it seemed her brother might not return to school in a while.<br><br>

              <p>As the daughter of an Emergency Room pediatrician, Bruna is constantly concerned for her mother’s health and wellbeing, especially as the ER sees more and more patients suspected to have COVID-19. She says the virus puts international human flow into focus, and calls for empathy in this difficult time. Bruna mentions how people protest whenever the president speaks on TV, and the fact that she has never watched the news more than she does today.<br><br>

              <p>Irura was scheduled to go on a Learning in the World program trip during spring break, but home in Kenya, where the government imposed a curfew from 7pm to 2am, making it hard for some working families. Irura talks about how people are protecting themselves and living amid this unusual shift in lifestyle, and mentions a suspected indirect contact with someone who had the virus - thankfully, he and his family are cleared after two weeks of strict self-isolation.<br><br>

            <h2>Words of Reflection</h2>
            <p>So many countries have published travel restrictions that 1he New York Times has an updating global list. Newfound connections like cross-regional aid and global livestream concerts seem paradoxical in the face of such a dividing crisis.</p>
            <p>I initially came to this project by reflecting on my own journey home, hearing about other international students who struggled to find a ticket back home or struggled to find a place to stay. The global scale of this pandemic brings our interconnected reality to the spotlight. and I think there is a lot to glean from the lived experience of this handful of international students. </p>
            <p>While this is far from the whole picture. I hope to highlight both the vulnerability and the potential within the international student community. The vulnerability comes into play when they find themselves stuck between their home country and the one they arc studying in. Their potential, however, lies in this unique position. having experience in cross-cultural communication and critical comparisons. </p>
            <p>As the world continues the battle against COVID-19.1 hope this can serve as a small archive of the special time that is the first half of 2020. </p>
