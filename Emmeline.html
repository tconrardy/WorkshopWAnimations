          <p>Due to association with the geographical origins of coronavirus, the Asian community has suffered an increase of hate crimes since the initial spread of COVID-19. From a man <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/06/brooklyn-woman-burned-outside-home-in-possible-acid-attack/">throwing acid onto a Chinese woman</a> taking out the trash in New York to a man <a href="https://nextshark.com/sams-club-hate-crime-texas-stabbing/">attempting to murder an entire family</a> of Burmese-Americans in Texas, <a href="https://racismiscontagious.com/">about 100 hate crimes against Asians occur per day on average.</a> As a result, many Asian families have begun taking extra precautions to avoid any opportunities for attack and are forced to live in fear not only of the virus but also of their neighbors. When a Chinese man was attacked in the town next to mine, for instance, my parents told me to stop going out after nightfall and to always keep the garage door closed.</p>
          <p> Strangely enough, very similar circumstances surrounding deadly diseases and hatred towards a certain group of people occurred just 40 years ago during the HIV epidemic of the 1980’s. The disease led to enormous waves of discrimination towards gay men, pushing the gay rights movement back while the president refrained from addressing the topic for five years after its initial discovery among the gay community. With insufficient medical help, those who tested HIV positive were kicked out of apartments, avoided in public, and many were left to die. To compare every aspect of Asian discrimination in 2020 to the horrors of the AIDS crisis is, as one writer puts it, <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/03/stop-comparing-response-coronavirus-early-response-aids-insulting/">“an insult to the bravery and sacrifice of the living and the dead”.</a> However, the public backlash against the particular minority groups it deemed as morally reprehensible during the spread of these diseases is indicative of a larger problem in the dynamics of different communities within American culture.</p>
          <p>One of the most obvious similarities between discrimination during the AIDS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic is in the colloquial names of the diseases. Trump’s insistence of calling coronavirus the “Chinese virus” because the virus originated and was spread first in China loosely parallels the way that AIDS was called the “gay plague” by the media. Headlines in a British newspaper, for instance, read <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/11/30/world-aids-day-1980s-headlines-tabloids/">“Britain threatened by gay plague”,</a> an idea that rings similarly to Trump’s tweet about supporting American industries <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/trump-tweets-about-coronavirus-using-term-chinese-virus-n1161161">“that are particularly affected by the Chinese virus”.</a> It is immediately apparent that use of this terminology alienates the group in question and blames them for the spread of a wider problem. By isolating these groups as the problem and creating a division between that group and the rest of the American people, the instigators of these names are playing on pre-existing lines drawn between groups of people and the “us-vs-them” mindset.</p>
          <p>Another problem shared between gay discrimination during the AIDS crisis and Asian discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic is in the identity of the targeted community itself. While gay men were statistically most affected by AIDS (along with some other minority groups), many people also believed that lesbians were equally susceptible to AIDS due to their association in the LGBTQ+ community – <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3397564?seq=23#metadata_info_tab_contents">despite the fact that lesbians are one of the communities least affected</a> by any sexually transmitted disease. Similarly during the coronavirus outbreak, people are not only targeting those of Chinese descent but anyone who looks vaguely Chinese, including other East Asian and Southeast Asian ethnicities – <a href="https://racismiscontagious.com/">in about 60% of reported cases of assault,</a> the victim has not been of Chinese descent. The fact that people not only blamed one minority group but also shifted the blame to other minority groups tied to the first minority group for no logical reason only further emphasizes the fact that this blame is born of pre-existing bias.</p>
          <p>One last important similarity between the two pandemics was the overwhelming national attitude of indifference until the disease began directly influencing majority groups. During the initial period while AIDS mainly affected gay men, people of African descent, and drug users, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3397564?seq=23#metadata_info_tab_contents">mainstream America paid little attention</a> to trying to combat the disease. As a whole, the disease was often described as <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3397564?seq=23#metadata_info_tab_contents">“exotic”</a> and thus not important to the bulk of American society. These negative attitudes severely detained medical research and any change in social practices that could have limited the disease’s spread, showing the public’s indifference toward whether minority groups like gay men and people of color lived or died. With coronavirus, the federal government neglected to pay as much attention as was necessary to the spread of the virus while it was still in China. In fact, many news outlets at the time focused more on the cruelty of the Chinese government towards the citizens of Wuhan than the danger of the disease spreading to other countries, and it was only after the virus spread to Europe that the US began paying more attention to the virus. Although there are a multitude of other reasons such as business interests that caused the US to react so slowly, it is important not to underestimate the social factor of viewing the virus as foreign and not a real problem in the US reaction towards the pandemic.</p>
          <p>Because the US government treated both diseases as alien and inconsequential, medical policies were inadequate for victims of the disease. Even now, the US is facing a shortage of medical supplies to deal with an ever-increasing amount of coronavirus patients. Meanwhile, this discrimination impacts the US far after the worst of the disease has passed. The AIDS crisis decimated the gay population and set the LGBTQ movement back as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive?fbclid=IwAR2VJScZWkfSOEICwDkNFZdLO7NrxTeFUiQuOheoLISXrVFMWXXh0iuAiT8.">people lashed out against the community</a> for their association with the virus.[8] And because anger during the coronavirus pandemic is tied to the country of China, there will likely be larger international impacts. China is the US’s largest trading partner, and as the US and China continue to blame each other for the spread of the virus, the relationship between the two countries only deteriorates more.  In this way, discriminatory social attitudes towards diseases impact our nation and our world. As the US inevitably continue to go through periods of social and economic stress, it is essential that we maintain a united front.</p>
