            <h1>The Effect of NYS Government Action on the COVID-19 Crisis</h1>

          <div class="regular">
            <p> In the midst of the current pandemic, an abundance of major events have taken place in a short amount of time. In such times, I wanted to find out if government action in the state of NY was helping to stop the spread of coronavirus. While researching, I found out that there has been a lot more government action in response to the pandemic than I initially thought. The following visualization is a timeline of State level action, along with updates on coronavirus cases in the state of New York State. Some things to keep in mind while viewing this timeline is that I may be missing some information due to the fact that this is very recent data and the government action described only applies to different counties in NY or the entire state of NY. I have also included a line graph that shows the progression of new coronavirus cases in the state of New York. The line graph reports on new cases per day, not the total number of cases.</p>

          <div class="regular">
            <p> Based on the information compiled on the timeline, the action that has been taken hasn’t been effective in decreasing the number of new cases. I assume this is due to the fact that the New York State government is not working concurrently with local governments in the state. For example, NYS Governor Cuomo declared a state of emergency in early March, while NYC Mayor de Blasio waited until the number of NYC cases were 95 to take similar action (Lapin, 2020). The public disagreement about closing NYC schools for the rest of the year further proves that these governments are not working in sync (Acevedo & Good, 2020). In South Korea, a country that has had massive success in containing the virus, there was unified government action on all levels (Jo, 2020). I assume that if the New York State government followed suit, more effective action would take place. That being said, because we are only in the first wave of the virus, it may be too early to speculate on the effectiveness of government action.</p>
