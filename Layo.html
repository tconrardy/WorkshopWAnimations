            <h1>The Effect of NYS Government Action on the COVID-19 Crisis</h1>

          <div class="regular">
            <p> In the wake of the current pandemic, NYC has become an epicenter for the coronavirus. With 185,000 cases and 19,000 deaths, the virus has claimed the lives of more New Yorkers than the 9/11 attacks (The New York Times). What has happened to New York City? I wanted to know what’s been going on in the city that I've grown to love. Did this happen because of a lack of government action at a critical time or is the coronavirus just too much for us to handle? In answering this question, I hope to provide insight to fellow new yorkers about how our government is protecting or not protecting us and things other state governments and people can learn from the current situation in New York City. </p>
            <p> In my research, I thought I’d be able to find a definite answer. However, I found that there isn’t clear either/or. The corona virus is heavily contagious on its own with a reproductive value of 2-2.5. That means on average, one infected person can spread the virus to two other people (“Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)”). This may not seem significant, but it has been detrimental for millions of people living in a relatively small, densely populated area.</p>
            <p> In addition, I have found that there was a lack of government action until cases soared. The only government action taken in response to the corona virus before March were federal travel restrictions in early February (Geraghty). Other than that, the lack of government action to enforce social distancing and the remarks from Mayor de Blasio and the president is evidence that governmental officials didn’t take the corona  virus seriously until late February/early March (Goldenberg,Geraghty). It was noted that de Blasio ignored warnings from scientists and a spike of 1156 hospital patients with flu-like symptoms, probably in the false hope that the virus wasn’t that bad (Goldenberg). </p>
            <p> However, despite an initial lack of action, new regulations and social distancing practices have slowed down the spread of the virus. According to the NYTimes, the growth rate has slowed significantly from February (The New York Times). Also, when accounting for testing fluctuations by looking at percentages rather than the number of cases, this data also shows that the number of cases are falling (The New York Times). However, the number of cases are still high, but Mayor de Blasio, Governor Cuomo, and the president have coordinated and planned to increase testing and help the city recover (“Trump Says ...”).</p>
