        <h3> <i>BEFORE THE BUBBLE BURST</i> </h3>
      <p> Back in early March, I opened my student mailbox for a final cleanout before spring break of senior year. Inside, I found the usual— mail from colleges I wouldn't be applying to, a graded essay from English class, an invitation to a club event I had missed by a week—alongside one larger envelope with three surgical masks inside. Within the week, I'd be flying from my boarding high school in Massachusetts back home to Washington state, and I had received several text reminders from both Mom and Dad to avoid people, cover my face with a turtleneck or scarf, and wear a mask at all times.</p>
         <p> But back in early March, I still lived in a bubble of sorts—not just one created by a unique high school campus environment, but also one of my own media consumption— and had half hoped that the masks, which looked so out of place in my mailbox, would not arrive. Back in early March, the policy for mask wearing endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was clear: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html">it was not recommended.</a></p>
        <p> "in all my classes we’ve been having discussions about healthy people who take masks away from health facilities in need so i just feel kind of bad," I texted my mom on March 6th in response to one set of her mask wearing reminders. As an add-on, I sent her a <a href="https://time.com/5794729/coronavirus-face-masks/">TIME magazine article</a> I had been reading that urged people to follow the then-current CDC recommendations. From there, our text conversation grew more tense, as non-in-person interactions sometimes do. Her perspective: "Junah. Listen. People should not feel bad about protecting themselves. And the messaging is doing that." My response: "I believe the article mom." </p>
        <p>In reflecting on this interaction now, I am frustrated by myself for many reasons. My mom, who had been paying attention to Korean news about the coronavirus since January, recommended then what the CDC only began recommending on April 3rd—that Americans wear “cloth face coverings… as an additional, voluntary public health measure,” a striking <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/10/829890635/why-there-so-many-different-guidelines-for-face-masks-for-the-public">departure from their previous position,</a> which told Americans bluntly that mask wearing would have no observable impact on the livelihoods of healthy Americans.</p>
        <p> I also know, though, that the arguments detailed in the TIME magazine article I sent my mom—that mask wearing had no real impact, that I didn’t want to be taking up resources (my mom informed me that the  were ones we already owned)—were not my only hesitations behind donning a black mask on my way home.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="regular">
        <h3> <i>YELLOW, PERILLED, & TRAVELING </i> </h3>
        <p> As an underclassmen in high school, I avoided sitting at lunch tables with only East Asian girls, and would label myself and my Asian friends with the same homogenizing language (“oh, that’s so Asian”) I would later learn to critique. And though I have since grown, this issue of mask wearing brought back my awareness to the uncomfortable ways in which I change my behavior in both public and private to become more palatable to non-Asian identifying people—to show I am English-speaking, to seem more chill, to distinguish myself from other East Asians. </p>
        <p> While getting ready in my dorm on the morning of my flight back home, I examined my masked face in the mirror and paused to note how incredibly… Asian I looked, a strange revelation to have while looking at a face I have been familiar with for 17 years. I read over my mom’s texts—“wear glasses instead of contact lenses”—and thought about how my accessories altered or added to my image. If I couldn’t communicate my American-ness through my facial expressions, could I through a branded jacket? Could I through a hairstyle? (I settled on a high bun.) If I made myself look younger, would that help? </p>
        <p> When I arrived at my terminal, the few people I saw wearing masks or cloth coverings looked East Asian, and while waiting by the gate, I spotted more than one pair of people eyeing masked figures or whispering as they walked past. As author Cathy Park Hong <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/magazine/asian-american-discrimination-coronavirus.html">wrote recently for “The New York Times,”</a> I felt that the masks “depersonalized their faces, making the stereotypically ‘inscrutable’ Asian face even more inscrutable, effacing even their age and gender.” And bluntly, I wanted to distinguish myself from those figures (not look “so Asian,” say)— find ways to reassure those around me of my cleanliness and health, to portray myself as non-threatening by appearing more American. </p>
        <p> At that point in time, I had heard of reports of Asian American mask-wearers being harassed on the street or physically assaulted, but I had been resistant to categorize those incidents under a larger, validating label that named a pattern. In wearing a mask, I didn’t feel unsafe or at risk, but rather as though I deserved to be labeled as diseased and foreign— as though I was something that needed to be explained, apologized for, or hidden.</p>
        <p> The truth I’ve been observing is that this global pandemic fits all too conveniently into existing racist narratives about yellow bodies. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/09/27/647989652/if-we-called-ourselves-yellow">this NPR article from 2018,</a> author Kat Chow proposes a reclamation of the word “yellow,” a color that has “long been considered noxious” and is sometimes used as a slur. She traces the history of the equation Asian = yellow, and describes the origins of the widely used term “yellow peril,” which refers to the perceived existential threat that East Asians pose to the Western world. Amidst spikes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/magazine/asian-american-discrimination-coronavirus.html">reports of discrimination</a> against Asian Americans throughout March, I could viscerally envision “yellow peril” in a way I hadn’t been able to before — as an image of faceless, contaminated, foreign, and truly threatening group of bodies invading a purer and more orderly Western world. </p>
        <p> Such images have in fact been driving policy making and violent action in America for decades, dating back to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese immigration to the U.S. for 60 years under justifications <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/09/27/647989652/if-we-called-ourselves-yellow">coded in the language of</a> ‘Asian invasions’ and yellow peril (the act also spurned widespread violence against Chinese populations throughout the American West). During a plague outbreak in 1899, <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/03/coronavirus-racism-disease-chinatown-bubonic-plague-honolulu/608149/">officials lost control of a sanitation fire</a> and burned down Chinatown in Honolulu, forcing around 5,000 Chinese, Japanese, and Native Hawaiian residents into refugee camps. In the early 20th century, American officials justified colonial rule in the Philippines by pointing to <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-us-racism-against-asian-americans-from-yellow-peril-to-model-minority-to-the-chinese-virus-135793">“‘tropical diseases’ festering in native bodies.”</a> </p>
        <p> In short, in the history of America and the West more broadly, Asia and “the East” at large have long been described with denigrating language that carries undertones of dirtiness and disease. This reality has consequential <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/what-does-the-coronavirus-tell-us-about-the-wests-image-of-asia-and-itself/">political implications</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/magazine/asian-american-discrimination-coronavirus.html">social ones</a>, and serves as a helpful lens through which we can begin thinking about the kind of new wave yellow peril we’re living in right now.</p>

        <h3> <i>REFLECTING ON THE IN-BETWEENS </i></h3>
        <p> About two weeks after arriving home, I started feeling less energetic than usual. The right side of my head would pulse every time I stood up, and I felt myself losing a hold on my ability to focus on schoolwork. After a few days of casting the feeling off as a migraine, I developed a fever, and my mom recommended I start self-quarantining in my room (to this day, I haven’t been tested for Covid-19). And for the next two or so weeks, I found ways to occupy myself while dealing with a host of unpredictable symptoms of varying intensity—a painful sore throat, consistent muscle soreness, two days of feeling normal followed by one day of vomiting, a strange rash, and more temporary fevers.</p>
        <p> Spending all day alone meant, for me, a lot of napping and listening to music, but also many opportunities for uninterrupted self reflection. One such instance of reflection came out of reading a Washington Post op-ed published on April 1st, in which former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang calls for Asian Americans to, as a means of combating a rise in hate crimes, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/01/andrew-yang-coronavirus-discrimination/">“embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before.”</a> This argument—that racism can be prevented by a hyper-projection of patriotism (Yang recommends I “wear red white and blue”)—felt reminiscent of advice given to Muslim Americans after 9/11, or comments made to survivors of sexual harassment and assault about dressing more conservatively.</p>
        <p>I was not conflicted about the op-ed itself. I felt, and still feel, that Yang’s rhetoric fed into “respectability politics,” wherein marginalized communities are told it is their responsibility to  change their looks or behaviors to avoid facing discrimination. I feel confident in asserting that no one should have to live a conditional existence because of their identity, modeling themselves after arbitrary standards of respectability in order to earn the approval of a dominant group and survive (i.e. taking off a face mask). </p>
        <p>I also felt it necessary to meditate on the reality that, for Asian Americans especially, respectability politics never operate in a vacuum. The “model minority myth” for example, which paints Asian Americans as a universally wealthy, educated, and successful demographic, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks">has historically been and continues to be used</a> by white America to reinforce the “American Dream” and downplay the effects of racism faced by other people of color. In other words, accepting a framework like Yang proposes, in which individual Asian Americans must prove themselves as more legitimate and worthy citizens, might also necessitate that other citizens be designated as comparatively less legitimate. </p>
        <p>But after reading Yang’s op-ed, I found myself thinking about a less comfortable but perhaps more meaningful insight: that while on the surface level, Yang’s words are easy to dismiss, I too continue to buy into and act on this toxic way of thinking. That while I find it easy to sit in my room and write quickly and purposefully about the myth of the American Dream, respectability politics, and the importance of empowerment, I find it harder to reckon with the ways in which I’ve failed to empower myself and others, even abstractly. The truth is that I’m always <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/minor-feelings-and-the-possibilities-of-asian-american-identity">counting the number of Asians in a room,</a> feeling uncomfortable when there are ‘too many,’ and grappling with the guilt that comes from being confronted with my own internalized biases. That even as I write down statistics about violence against Asian Americans, I am hesitant to claim “racism” on my own behalf. And that as much pride as I feel locally—in myself, in my family—the Asian American identity itself remains for me, even in a time as abnormal as this one, ever elusive and difficult to rally around in a way that feels cathartic and righteous. </p>

        <h3> <i> RESOLVING MASKED TENSIONS </i> </h3>
        <p> After fully recovering from my strange three week illness, I sat my mom down for an informal interview. We talked mainly about the coronavirus— how grateful she has been that people in our area seem to be adhering to social distancing recommendations, how frustrated she was by the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html">lack of early action</a> in preparation for a threat they knew existed, and how scared she is by the uncertainty of not knowing many things. When I asked her about her greatest stressors during this time, she started talking immediately about the U.S. healthcare system in the context of my sickness: </p>
      <blockquote> “Even when you were sick, we didn’t know what it was…. Just that itself creates a lot of anxiety for me. If we were in Korea, I don’t think I would’ve worried about that. Like I would know you would be treated if you had coronavirus. I know you’re gonna get the medicine that you need, that immediate attention. And I know that early detection will prevent a further situation. Here, you never know.” </blockquote>
        <p>The truth is, she had been feeling those specific anxieties for a month in a way that I only started to feel upon leaving my high school campus bubble. That is to say, while back in March I was weighing the consequences of not wearing a mask against the negative stares and judgements I felt sure I’d receive, for my mom, those hesitations were foolish and trivial. While I was in my dorm trying to find ways to explain that I didn’t want to be seen wearing a mask, she was waiting for me to confirm the delivery of a shipment she had sent me a few days prior—one mask to leave in my dorm, one mask to wear on the way home, and one mask just in case. And while I was, in real time, blindly analyzing and wanting to talk about what our disagreement revealed about our differences, she was feeling frustrated by what she perceived as my inability to grasp at literal happenings—that I was coming home, that I might be surrounded by infected and unaware people on the way, that all I had to do was put on the damn mask and make it home safely, and did I really think now was a good time to talk about cultural differences? </p>
        <p>When I asked her, in our recent conversation, to talk about that argument, she answered in two parts. First, she talked about feeling as though she was fighting against a wave of misinformation from my brother and I, who were consuming solely American media. Secondly, and more strikingly to me, she revealed that at the time, she had felt unfairly labeled as an “Asian parent getting paranoid”: </p>
        <blockquote>“Of course, I grew up in a country with a completely different culture— whatever I do is influenced by how I grew up and how my belief system is different. But you guys sometimes categorize certain ways of behaving or certain ways of communicating as, ‘oh, it’s just a typical Asian parent’.... And I want to have my own strong position.”</blockquote>
        <p>Listening to her words felt both painful and familiar— both reminding me of how my language can have unintended consequences, and echoing of my own desire to break away from stereotypes and images that I perceive to be projected onto my face. </p>
        <p>And as I sat on the floor of my mom’s room, watching her think and speak in a language once foreign to her and empathizing with the desire to possess one’s “own strong position,” I thought about how similar we were. At the risk of sounding cliché, I wondered if we weren’t both wanting to rid ourselves of our own types of masks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="regular">
        <h3><i>ON THE JOYS OF BEING, AT HOME.</i> </h3>
        <p>This might be the last time that my mom and I ever live together. I suppose I technically left home at 13, when deciding to go to boarding school, and though I don’t regret that decision for myself, I sometimes do because of my mom. Sure, living away from my mom for the bulk of four years has, in some ways, positively impacted our relationship—being aware of limited time can make time feel more precious, more urgent, encouraging us to be more lighthearted and forgiving and vulnerable. But even still, I know that we both think about lost time, and what it means to do so much growing and learning and finding yourself in a place that is not home. </p>
        <p>Earlier this year, I took a class on Asian American literature and film, looking to deepen my connection to a broader community I’ve sometimes struggled to identify with. During a specific unit where we studied Japanese internment in America, I could not help but think of my mom, around whom I avoid using the term “Asian American,” instead referring to myself as “Korean American,” because I know that Japan is the one topic my mom cannot mask her anger and emotion for. And though I have empathized with her anger, which is based in a deep knowledge of the traumatic and oppressive colonial history between Japan and Korea, I have also been aware that my inherited anger makes it even harder to embrace that fact of my existence which is so obvious and objective to others (and yet so fragile and situational to me)— my Asian-American-ness. At school, in this way and in so many others, I’m always focused on tensions—interpersonal, generational, cultural, familial—a heightened, disembodied, and sometimes cruelly clinical awareness that broadens my perspective as a student, but often makes home feel more foreign and family less comfortable. </p>
        <p> But when I’m actually at home, not visualizing it from far away, I think less about tensions. Instead, I help mom make comfort foods that sit familiarly on my tongue, watch nostalgic TV shows about Seoul in the 80’s with my brother, and speak in a half-Korean and half-English way that feels more natural than either or, and much more natural than the stunted way we communicate over text. I’m told to stop overthinking, and to relearn what my body needs from me— sleep, nutrition, respect. I listen to mom laugh over the phone with her sisters a half world away and find old Korean singers by copy-pasting their names on Spotify. There are certainly times when I imagine myself back at school or elsewhere, somewhere I have more ‘freedoms,’ but after over a month of being home, I realize that I can stand in front of a mirror and see my face again—look at my face without thinking about myself in terms of being too Asian and not being Asian enough. </p>
        <p>“This might be the last time we ever live together.” After almost four years of high school, I know now that I’m capable of living alone and of living far away. But I also know now that there will always be times when I just need to go <i>home</i>—home not so much a place as a proximity to mom—to set down the burden of having to represent myself and to reground myself in a more literal lifestyle, one where I prioritize how to be well over questions about what it means to be. In the wake of a more uncertain future for many individuals and communities, I am grateful for meaningful, though perhaps temporary, certainties: to be young and healthy, to have my face unmasked, to have made it home. </p>
