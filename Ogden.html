            <p>In March 1976, populist Argentine president Isabel Peron was ousted from office during a coup d'etat by a military junta. The new right-wing dictatorship began a seven year campaign, known as the “Dirty War,” against any dissidents suspected of opposing the newly formed government. After closing the national legislature, imposing censorship, and banning all trade unions, the military began kidnapping, interrogating, torturing, and killing educators, students, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists, priests, and left-wing activists. According to an article in the New York Times, Argentina’s foreign minister at the time, Cesar Guzetti, was in frequent communication with America’s secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, informing him that the military was aggressively cracking down on so-called “terrorists.” According to the CIA, between 10,000 and 30,000 Argentine citizens disappeared during this time, most of which were presumably tortured and killed. In 2002, per request of several human rights organizations, the United States partly declassified roughly 4,700 State Department records related to the Dirty War. Not only did those documents aid numerous judicial hearings in Argentina, they also helped to shed light on a period of shameful American foreign policy which failed to condone and even supported brutal right-wing tactics.</p>
            <p> These two watercolor paintings of the view from my balcony in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina were originally inspired from a conversation with my grandmother, Monica Quinterno, in which she compared life during the coronavirus pandemic to living under the notoriously violent military dictatorship. </p>

            <p>In our landline telephone call, my grandmother described her feelings while watching tanks roll down the main avenue from the balcony of the apartment I live in today. While my grandmother was lucky enough to not have been targeted by the secret police, she reminisced on the dangers of misinformation and press censorship. She said that while the government tried to keep all the details about their violent campaign secret, most people knew what was really going on. While the government controlled media never mentioned anything out of the normal, stories of sightings of “body bags” being dropped from helicopters into the rivers and of hundreds of bodies washing up on the Argentine shore circulated the country via gossip.
          I started and finished both paintings while serving over a month in quarantine during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Having grown up in an era where “fake news” is a hot topic of discussion and misinformation unfortunately plagues the vast internet, I felt like I truly understood all the concerns that my grandmother carefully listed. While the scenes I illustrated are 44 years apart, they are similar in many ways, as I share the same feelings of fear for the dangers of the outside world and the same concerns that some humans are trying to hide the truth from the rest. </p>
