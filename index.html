Primarily through interviews, I want to look at why these organizations or small businesses do what they do specifically in Portland, and how they may contribute to the values or defining factors of the broader city community.
          Given the closure or takeout limitations of many restaurants, bakeries, cafes, etc due to COVID-19, both food retail and suppliers for those places are being drastically affected. Are those measures changing the identity of restaurants/cafes or even neighborhoods?</a>

I specifically want to look at information retention rates, level of interest/engagement, and level of connection and empathy felt towards the teacher and fellow classmates both in person and online. I don’t know what my artifact would be for this though yet - maybe a flowchart of how the body processes information during each version of learning (as well as the long term effects).</a>
