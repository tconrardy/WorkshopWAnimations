          <p>
            &emsp;I really make an effort to try to talk to customers (or “guests,” as we’re supposed to call them,) as I’m ringing up their groceries. I’ve been really surprised to see how personal many people get when you show an interest. Maybe it’s because we’re all cooped up with family and it’s nice to have a stranger to talk to? Take yesterday for example. A soon-to-be grandmother vented about her daughter, who was due to have a baby last Friday. “If she’s much later, then something might be wrong, and I’m not sure if the hospitals will have the capacity to handle it.” It took a lot of will power to just keep bagging her groceries instead of giving her a hug. Another man’s eyes lit up when I asked about his West Point hat. (Pierce wants to go into the military, so it caught my eye.) He told me a story about how his daughter had been recruited to attend West Point, but changed her mind after she attended a summer training camp there. “She didn’t think that she could do it. I still think that she could have done it,” he said proudly. Later that day, I asked a man if he had any cats. (It was a fairly rhetorical question; I had already scanned three bags of cat food.) His eyes lit up and he told me that he rescued strays. He currently had two cats. (Or was it three? I don’t remember.) Later, a woman with a Russian accent came through. I asked how she was doing with social distancing. She said that she was feeling a little stir crazy but ultimately fine, and asked how I was doing. I replied that I was sad that classes were online, and how upset I was that I couldn’t attend my regular history or Russian classes. “You take Russian?” she asked. “Да, я говорю по-русски,” I replied. We chatted in Russian for a bit, and I found that she was from an area of Siberia not far from where our Learning in the World trip to Russia went last summer. (I also found that my Russian was far rustier than I realized!) I also checked out an older couple that confused me a bit. The woman was outfitted in a face mask, gloves, long sleeves, and a pack of disinfectant wipes. The man who accompanied her was wearing no protective gear whatsoever. I didn’t ask, but wondered to myself how two people could be shopping together and have such different attitudes towards the virus. I rang up a mom who said that she had five kids at home. Some were struggling with online elementary school, others were struggling because of the shortage of baby wipes. I rang up another woman with almost two cartfuls of snack foods. “Stocking up on snacks for home?” I asked. “No, my office is making care packages for all of the local law enforcement who still have to work during the pandemic,” she replied. I was struck that, after spending much of my day enforcing purchase limits on people hoarding for themselves, someone was buying food for others. She had more packs of goldfish than she was allowed, but I didn’t say anything. And those are just the customers that I remember off the top of my head from yesterday! Maybe it’s just because I’m a fan of short stories, but I think that there’s something powerful about these little snapshots that I get of people’s lives.

          <p>&emsp;One of the first people to walk down the aisle of lane ten that day was an elderly woman with a cart full of groceries. I went through my normal routine of cleaning down the belt and apologizing for the wait.</p>
          <p>“Sorry about that, we’re just trying to keep everything clean. How are you?”</p>
          <p>“I’m good, how are you?”</p>
          <p>“Good; just trying to keep everything clean, keep things moving."</p>
          <p>&emsp;We continued to chat as I scanned and bagged her groceries. Eventually, we came to talking about her granddaughter. The woman said that she hadn’t been able to see her 18-month-old granddaughter during the heightened social distancing measures, which was especially hard given that the woman usually watched her granddaughter while the girl’s parents were at work. She talked about how hard it had been to go from seeing her granddaughter for ten or more hours a day to only over the occasional Facetime. The woman said that whenever they did videochat, her granddaughter seemed more confused and upset than anything, and would cry “grandma!” at the screen, confused at why her caretaker wasn’t there in person.</p>
          <p>&emsp;But she was more worried about her grandson. He had been brought to the hospital for a severe case of dehydration. She, of course, was not allowed to visit him, as the hospital was trying to keep family members out of the Emergency Room to slow the spread of the virus. Her worried expression turned to one of frustration.</p>
          <p>“This would all go away if people would just do what they're supposed to.”</p>
          <p>&emsp;I agreed, bagged the remainder of her groceries, and gave her a receipt. The quick transition between grandmotherly concern and grandmotherly anger stuck with me. I only hoped that she would get to see her grandkids again soon.</p>

        <div class="beltitem" id="story2">
          <p>&emsp;A while later, a man came down my aisle with a cartful of groceries. He looked to be stocking up for a while. I scanned some meat, boxes of macaroni, and a couple boxes of cereal.</p>
          <p>“Do you have kids at home?”</p>
          <p>“Two. They’re going nuts.”</p>
    	    <p>&emsp;We traded stories about boys (his sons, my brothers,) stuck at home making trouble and neglecting their online school. I scanned four one-and-a-half-gallon jugs of water on the bottom of his cart. I asked about his Rick and Morty shirt, prompting a conversation about the most recent episodes of the show. As I was scanning a loaf of bread and we were chatting about the upcoming May 3rd Rick and Morty release, my manager walked by. Something on the floor seemed to catch her eye, and she walked over to me.</p>
          <p>“You do know that there's a two-item-per-guest limit on water, right?” she asked me. I had completely forgotten that water products were part of the pandemic shopping limitations, as I had primarily had to enforce the 1-item limit on paper products. She apologized to the man and reclaimed two of the water jugs as I deducted the jugs from his total.</p>
          <p>&emsp;Not really knowing how to behave now that my manager had just taken two of his waters, I continued bagging the man’s items and making the occasional small talk. I mentioned that I was from Colorado, and he told me about how he’d always wanted to live in the mountains. As my manager walked by again, he raised his voice a tad and said, “it just sucks that my family of four only has ten gallons of water to drink for the week.” It wasn’t at all related to our conversation, so I was taken aback. After she had passed, he just continued our conversation as if nothing had happened. He fuddled with the card machine for a minute or so. (The reader is finicky sometimes.) I gave him his receipt and wished him luck keeping his kids occupied during social distancing. He thanked me and went on his way. </p>

        <div class="beltitem" id="story3">
          <p>&emsp;	A woman approached the belt with an unusually full cart. Her cartload did not, however, consist of the food or household essentials that most of the other guests had. Her cart was overflowing with Easter supplies. I rang up peeps, chocolate bunnies, candy eggs. I rang up two woven baskets and two packs of easter grass. I rang up water guns and toys and plastic easter eggs. I rang up clothing with bunnies and cutesy Easter puns on them.</p>
          <p>“Do you have kids at home?”</p>
          <p>“Yep!”</p>
          <p>“Are they looking forward to Easter?”</p>
          <p>“Mmhm.”</p>
          <p>&emsp;	She pulled her phone from her pocket, signaling that our conversation was over. I didn’t particularly mind. I was fairly entertained watching the climbing total on the cash register screen. I finally scanned and bagged the last item, and checked the screen to read the woman her total. She whipped out a credit card, swiped it, and was on her way. I felt bad for being judgemental, but I just couldn’t shake it from my mind: her cartload of Easter supplies cost more than an entire month’s worth of my wages. I don’t know if that made me feel resentful, or sad, or just sorry for her kids who would be wearing frilly “hoppy easter” shirts for the rest of the month. However it made me feel, it certainly stuck with me.</p>

        <div class="beltitem" id="story4">
          <p>&emsp;	A man and his young daughter rolled their cart up. I wiped down the belt, and apologized for the wait. I felt especially bad since they had already been waiting for a while behind the previous shopper: the woman with the Easter supplies. </p>
          <p>“That’s okay. We just appreciate that you’re here,” the man said. It was a relief to hear.</p>
          <p>&emsp; I scanned and bagged their few groceries before encountering an Amazon Fire TV stick. Like most electronics, the remote had a pesky anti-theft device around it. My heart dropped. I knew that I was about to make this man and his daughter’s already long wait even longer; no matter how many times anyone teaches me, I always struggle with removing security devices. I kept my cool, and unhooked the security device removal tool from its place at my register. I ran the edge of the tool along the notches on the security device and waited for a click. I heard the click, and tried to unlock the the package's security device. No dice. I tried again. And again. I fumbled with the box a few more times before flashing my lane light to flag down a manager. Eventually she came over, unlocked the security device — I felt ever so slightly better since she also struggled with it for a moment before popping it open — and left. I sheepishly scanned the remote and read the man his total. He swiped his credit card, and took his bags. As I was beginning to wipe down the belt for the next customer, he pulled a ten dollar bill out of his wallet and placed it on the counter. </p>
          <p>“That’s your tip for being here.” He left before I could say anything.</p>
          <p>&emsp; I wasn’t particularly sure what to do. I tucked the bill to the side of my register and started ringing up the next customer. As I bagged her first item, I noticed that the man had forgotten a bag on the bagging counter; the very Fire stick with which I had fumbled for so long. I was horrified that after all of the wait that I had put him through for the fairly expensive device, he had left it.</p>
          <p>“Ma’m, if you’d excuse me for one moment, I’m just going to go make sure that a customer doesn’t leave without this bag.”</p>
          <p>&emsp;	I grabbed the bag and sprinted out the exit. In retrospect, I must have looked completely deranged sprinting out the door with a single bag. Once I was outside, I scanned the parking lot, and saw the man and his daughter loading groceries into their trunk. I ran across the parking lot.</p>
          <p>“Excuse me, sir?” The man was clearly surprised to see me. “I’m so sorry, but I didn’t want you to forget your bag.” I meekly offered up the plastic bag. The man thanked me for the bag, and I ran back inside, now terrified that I would have upset the next customer with my absence. I rounded the coralle of carts and screeched to a halt at my register. </p>
          <p>“Sorry about the wait, ma’m,” I said, still catching my breath.</p>
          <p>“Do you run track?” she asked incredulously. I nodded, and we talked about hurdles as I scanned her groceries. With the NEPSTA season cancelled, it looked like hurdling over shopping carts would have to do.</p>

          <p>&emsp;A woman approached with a basket of groceries. I asked her how her day was, and she talked about the weather as I bagged her items. </p>
          <p>“Strange times that we live in,” she said.</p>
          <p>“How are you holding up with all of this craziness?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Well you know, I really don’t understand it all. I think that it’s really just a ruckus that’s been kicked up by the media. President Trump says that it’s all fake, so I’m not too worried,” She replied. I struggled not to raise an eyebrow.</p>
          <p>“Mmm.” My ambiguous grunt seemed to be a satisfactory indication of agreement to her. I bagged the rest of the groceries as she pulled cash from her wallet.</p>
          <p>“Have a lovely rest your day,” I said as I handed the woman her change and a receipt.</p>
          <p>“You too, hon,” she replied cheerily before turning and walking away. </p>

          <p>&emsp;	As I finished up with a customer, I grabbed the cleaning solution and a new wipe. I was used to having to ask customers to wait to start loading their groceries onto the belt, but the man who was next in line was maintaining a hefty distance. His beard was pinched against his face by an N95 mask; he was definitely taking as many precautions as he could. I wiped down the belt as he waited back beyond the magazine rack. </p>
          <p>“Alrighty, you can start loading whenever you’re ready. Sorry about that wait, we’re just trying to keep everything clean.” </p>
          <p>&emsp; Normally a guest might respond with “oh, that’s alright,” or “okay.” The man didn’t say anything, but I didn’t think much of it. I started scanning his items.</p>
          <p>“How are you today?” I asked. No response. I looked up to see the man staring back at me. I held eye contact for a moment, before jerking my gaze back to the scanner. I bagged the rest of his groceries in silence. I rang up his total. He swiped his card. I handed him his receipt.</p>
          <p>“Have a nice day.”</p>
          <p>&emsp; He turned and left without a response.</p>

          <p>&emsp;	A couple approached my register with a basket of groceries. What struck me about them was that I actually recognized them. I had rung them up just a couple of days prior. They didn’t seem to remember me, but that was okay. They were just as friendly as they had been the first time. They asked if they could use a reusable basket that they had brought instead of plastic bags. I told them that yes, they could, but I wasn’t allowed to handle any reusable bags. The woman said that this was fine, and the man swung a basket up onto the bagging station to begin loading their groceries. I laughed out loud. The basket was about the same size and shape of a normal handheld basket that you’d use in a grocery store, except the basket was lined in recycled jeans to make the entire basket look like an enormous pair of jean shorts. They seemed excited that I enjoyed their basket. I rang up their groceries and wished them a nice day. </p>

        <div class="beltitem" id="story8">
          <p>&emsp;	A middle-aged woman approached with a cartful of groceries. We exchanged a couple of pleasantries, and I began scanning her groceries. It was a nice day, so she didn’t have a jacket on; just a Ringgold High hockey t-shirt.</p>
          <p>“Are you a hockey fan?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, both of my boys play. My son is a senior on Ringgold’s varsity team,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“Oh no… I’m a senior too; my track season just got cancelled. How’s he taking it?”</p>
          <p>“Well he’s just devastated. They were probably headed to states, and maybe even nationals in Dallas this year. He was really excited for his last season with the team, but now of course it’s all cancelled. A lot of his classmates are upset about graduation or prom, but he’s just upset about the hockey season.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah, I’m sort of the same way. But the way that I see it, if it keeps other people safe, then it’s worth it,” I replied. </p>
          <p>“Well of course, but I still feel bad for all of you seniors,” she said with a sympathetic look. “What district are you in?” she asked.</p>
          <p>“I actually go to boarding school just north of Boston,” I replied, garnering the standard look of stifled incredulity from the woman. I proceeded on my well-practiced spiel about how my family had moved a few years ago, the schools weren’t very good in Colorado, Pittsburghers aren’t really familiar with the concept of boarding school because the public schools here are so good, yadda yadda. “I’m just worried that I won’t ever get to see my friends again… Or at least not my underclassman friends. And I don’t know when we’ll get to go back to get our stuff. And we still don’t know what our graduation will look like...”</p>
          <p>&emsp;I cut off my moment of self-pity. The woman gave another apologetic look and wished me good luck with everything. I wished her good luck with keeping her boys busy during quarantine and handed her the bags of groceries. </p>
          <p>&emsp;I have yet to come to a decision on how upset we seniors are allowed to be; how upset any of us are allowed to be at missing milestones big or small. Am I allowed to grieve for a senior spring that never was when there are others caring for the sick, worrying for the dying, and mourning the dead? Am I allowed to be anxious about my safety as a grocery store worker when there are healthcare workers dying at much higher rates? Am I allowed to worry about my family’s future in the economic crash triggered by the pandemic even if my family has food and a roof over our heads? Maybe it’s just a way to cope — a way to get through the days working amidst masked shoppers or writing from home with my quarantined family — but so far, the answer to all of those questions has been no. </p>
          <p>&emsp;With everything that’s happening, I have yet to find a way to justify pouting about my own circumstances when there are others who have it far worse than I do. But then again, how does one justify grief or sadness or worry when there will always be someone in more dire circumstances? Is there some rubric by which we can assess our feelings as valid or petty? Some cheat sheet by which we can check that our pain is worth sharing or reflecting on? The short answer: no. So I really don’t know. I don’t know what to feel or how to feel it while the city and the nation and the world are all just big soups of emotion. So I just clock in on time. I keep the belt clean. I ask people questions about their days. And I feel for them. Maybe if I can’t feel for myself, I can at least empathize with others. So, for just a moment, I was sad that after all that he’d been through, a boy whom I’d never met would miss out on one last championship with his team. And then I picked up my spray bottle and pushed the thought to the back of my mind. </p>
          <p>“Sorry about the wait. How are you today?”</p>

          <p>“Thank you so much for filling them so full; normally I’d use reusable bags, but I’m glad to use as few plastic ones as possible since we’re not allowed to use the reusable ones,” she said with a smile.</p>
          <p>“Oh, well you’re actually allowed to bring in reusable bags, you just have to bag them yourself so that we’re not touching bags that might have been exposed to the virus,” I replied. Her eyes lit up.</p>
          <p>“Good to know! I’ll make sure to bring my plastic bags next time.”</p>
          <p>She took her bags and left. It was a small win, but still enough to make me smile just a little bit.</p>

          <p>&emsp;They both looked to be in their early thirties. First I scanned a foam baseball bat with plastic balls to match. Kids? Too soon to tell. I scanned some groceries before hitting a pack of juice boxes. Kids? I would think so…? I didn’t ask yet. Finally, five boxes of lunchables came down the belt.</p>
          <p>“Do you have kids at home?” I asked. The woman’s eyes lit up. </p>
          <p>“No!” she exclaimed with glee. “I just really love lunchables!” </p>

          <p>&emsp;A lanky man approached my aisle, whistling. He handed me the few items that he had, likely to save me the trouble of cleaning the belt. I would have to clean it anyway, but I appreciated the thought.</p>
          <p>“It’s nice to hear someone else whistling,” I said as I rang up his items. “I love to whistle; sometimes I do it without thinking about it. Bad habit!” I joked.</p>
          <p>“No, it’s a good habit,” he said with a smile. I’m not quite sure how to describe that smile. Mystical sounds too dramatic; it was simple, yet somehow seemed deeply wistful. One apt description comes to mind: my friends and I often joke that some people just give off “immortal vibes.” They walk or talk or smile with the quiet confidence and grace of someone who has been here for far longer than we have and knows that they will be here long after we’re gone. I’d like to think that I met some sort of wandering whistling demigod that Saturday morning. Or maybe he’s just a guy who wanted a Coke and a pack of Altoids. Who’s to say?</p>

          <p>&emsp;A man wearing a scarf and a mask rolled a packed cart of groceries up to the belt. I eyed two packs of paper towels at the back of the cart. I knew that I would have to confiscate one of them because of the one-item-per-person limit on paper products, but I didn’t know how he would respond and decided that I’d rather start out on the right foot.
          “Sorry about the wait,” I said as I cleaned down the belt. “Just trying to keep everything clean. How are you today?”</p>
          <p>&emsp;He nestled his mask below his chin.</p>
          <p>&emsp;“I’m doing alright. How are you?” the man asked with a smile. I had forgotten how much easier it was to tell what people were saying when they weren’t wearing masks. Being unilaterally deaf, I can usually hear okay, but rely in part on reading people’s lips. Masks shield people’s faces so that I can’t read lips and they muffle the sound of people’s voices so that it’s even harder to hear them. I knew that he should probably be wearing the mask, but I found myself slightly grateful that he wasn’t. (And subsequently found myself slightly guilty about feeling slightly grateful.)</p>
          <p>“I’m doing alright. Just trying to keep things moving, keep things clean.”</p>
          <p>I scanned a few of his groceries, commenting on a few of the snack foods.</p>
          <p>“My brothers have been wolfing down any snack that enters our house, now that they’re home doing online schooling. They’re not the most focused of online schoolers,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I know. I’m a teacher, and it’s been a learning process for all of us,” he replied.</p>
          <p>“Oh, what grade do you teach?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“I teach sixth grade special ed,” he replied. We talked about the struggles of online schooling for students who often already have the odds stacked against them with regular curricula. He talked about how proud he was of all of his kids with ADHD or other learning disorders who had managed to stay focused. He asked whether I was still in school, and we talked a little bit about Andover. He asked about my college plans. It turned out that his uncle used to be the dean of the medical college at the university that I’m planning on attending in the fall. It also happened that the man and I had very similar majors; I’m majoring in international affairs, while he was a history/political science double major. I asked how, after getting degrees in political science and history, he had ended up teaching.</p>
          <p>“I just wanted to help people,” he said. “Teaching seemed like the way to do it.”</p>
          <p>&emsp;I nodded thoughtfully and reached for the next item on the conveyor belt. I felt the plastic packaging before I saw it. It was time.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I’m so sorry, but we’re limiting each guest to one of each paper product, so I can’t ring up both of these packs of paper towels,” I said. I hesitated for a moment, worried that our long conversation would be ruined by the inconvenience.</p>
          <p>“Oh, that’s totally fine! Don’t worry about it!” he said with a grin. I can’t say why I was so invested in retaining this fleeting friendship that we seemed to have formed — I would likely never see this man again — but nevertheless, his nonchalance was a relief to me. I rang up his total and finished packing the last few of his groceries as he paid. I handed him his bags and wished him a good day.</p>
          <p>“You too!” he said over his shoulder as he walked away with his precariously balanced cartful of groceries.</p>

          <p>&emsp;I almost always ask people about their pets when I encounter pet food. Pets are like kids; people love talking about them. But asking someone whether they have kids can be a touchy subject. Pets are far less complicated. So when a woman loaded a bag of dog food onto the belt, I was thrilled.</p>
          <p>“Do you have a dog?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Well, he’s not my dog,” she replied. “He’s my parents’ dog. I haven’t seen him since he was a puppy.”</p>
          <p>&emsp;We talked about her parents’ dog, who had grown older in her years away. She had been studying and teaching, trying to find her place in the world of academia. After finishing grad school at one Ivy League University, she went to teach at another. She taught philosophy. All of this struck me with some surprise. I would have guessed that she was in her mid to late twenties; seemingly too young to be teaching already. As she spoke, a dormant insecurity snaked its way to the forefront of my mind. Both of these institutions which she spoke about so casually had waitlisted me barely a week earlier. I tried to wave off the thought and continued to ask the woman questions about her work.</p>
          <p>&emsp;More recently, she had been too busy to visit her parents and their dog because she had moved. The woman explained that she was now teaching at a different university (one which, my now seemingly ingrained academic elitism reminded me, was also an Ivy League school). She had left her previous school out of distaste for the old-guard politics of the school’s philosophy department.</p>
          <p>“It was just too weirdly political there for an untenured young woman,” she said.</p>
          <p>“Hm,” I responded. I felt stupid not having a better response, but I didn’t have time to think of one now; I had scanned the last item on the belt. I rang up her total, stood in silence as she paid, and handed her a receipt.</p>
          <p>“Have a great day,” I said with a smile.</p>
          <p>“You too!” she said, flashing a smile in return.</p>

          <p>&emsp;With people being home, being hungry, and being bored, there’s a lot of baking going on in Pittsburgh these days. Every day, I ring up boxes upon boxes of cake mix, bags upon bags of sugar, and more jumbo cartons of eggs than regular dozen-sized boxes. The woman unloading her groceries onto the conveyor belt was no exception. She had a big carton of eggs, some sugar, a couple of lemons, and two big bags of flour.</p>
          <p>“Doing some baking?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“I’m not much of a baker, but my daughter-in-law has really wanted to make lemon bars. I grabbed all of this stuff for her because she’s been having a hard time finding it anywhere else. Whole Foods has been out of flour for a week!” the woman replied. I was shocked, having been unaware that flour was in such short supply.</p>
          <p>“Well I’m glad that you found what you needed here. I’m a sucker for anything with lemon in it, so I love lemon bars. My mom bakes them a lot better than I do, though.” We chatted about our mutual lack of baking talent for a little while as I scanned the rest of her groceries. Soon enough, she had picked up her bags and was on her way.</p>

          <p>&emsp;A man with a tattered baseball cap, a thick Carhartt jacket, and an N95 mask set his basket of groceries down on my belt. He was a familiar image to me —  I was used to seeing construction workers like him in masks like these on my dad’s job sites — but it was strange to see a man wearing such a mask not while painting or sanding, but buying groceries.</p>
          <p>&emsp;We exchanged a few pleasantries. He seemed like a nice enough guy. I began to scan his groceries.</p>
          <p>“It’s funny, I’m only used to seeing masks like that on my dad’s job sites,” I noted, as I bagged another item.</p>
          <p>“Yeah, I have a bunch of ‘em saved from work, so I should be all set for however long this thing goes,” he replied. I nodded, and kept scanning his groceries. We talked a little bit about the social distancing and the trials of being at home all day. He was thankful that he had been able to make a trip to the store; it “kept him sane.” I wondered if it had occurred to him that neither I nor any of my coworkers were wearing masks. I pondered mentioning to him that our store had run out of masks a couple of weeks before because of how short supplies were all over the country. I thought better of it, and rang up the rest of his groceries.</p>
          <p>&emsp;That evening, as I ate my dinner and watched news reports about healthcare workers sewing masks from t-shirts, I thought about that man again. I pictured him sitting on his couch with a pint of ice cream and a box of N95 masks on the floor beside him. And it made me absolutely furious.</p>

          <p>&emsp;A man with a Pittsburgh Pirates sweatshirt came through my checkout lane.
          “It’s nice to see some Pittsburgh gear. I go to school up in Boston and see far too much Patriots and Red Sox gear for my liking,” I remarked.</p>
          <p>“Oh that’s unfortunate,” he replied. </p>
          <p>&emsp;We chatted about the Pirates and the upcoming MLB season. </p>
          <p>“I think that they’re just going to play the entire season down in Arizona,” the man said.</p>
          <p>“I mean sure, you’ve already got all of the spring training fields set up down there,” I replied. The man seemed excited that I knew what he was talking about. I didn’t have the heart to continue that it was probably a terrible idea to hold the season in Arizona. Even without fans, the proximity of the players and all of the personnel running the games would still be dangerous. I’d be surprised if it happens. But I didn’t say that to the man in the Pirates hoodie. Let the guy dream of ballgames that would never be.</p>

          <p>&emsp;I almost immediately saw the two bottles of hand soap towards the middle of the belt.
          “Ma’m,” I said, prompting the woman to look up from the items that she was loading onto the conveyor belt. “I’m so sorry, but we’re only allowing each guest to purchase one bottle of hand soap per visit right now,” I said. </p>
          <p>“Oh, okay, sorry. That’s fine,” she replied. She rummaged through the cart for a few moments. “Are there limits on these?” she asked, holding up four small boxes. I squinted, but couldn’t see them clearly all the way at the end of the belt.</p>
          <p>“Sorry, what are they?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“It’s baby Tylenol,” she replied. I checked the product limit cheat sheet tucked behind my register’s keyboard. No baby Tylenol on the list.</p>
          <p>“No, those are fine, ma’m.”</p>
          <p>“Okay, good,” the woman said. “My 15-month-old daughter has a really bad ear infection, and I’m really nervous, because it’s her fifth one. She was supposed to have tubes put in, but obviously they can’t now with everything that’s going on”</p>
          <p>“Oh, that actually happened to me!” I exclaimed. “If it’s any consolation, I’m deaf in my right ear now, but I’m doing just fine.” In retrospect, I realize that this was almost certainly not as reassuring as I meant it to be, nor was it necessarily accurate. Though I lost my hearing sometime before the age of five and also had numerous serious ear infections, the ear infections were only one possible cause of my lost hearing. I did not, however, consider this during my ill-guided attempt to reassure the mother before me. </p>
          <p>“But your daughter sounds like a fighter,” I continued. “If she’s made it through five already, I’m sure that she can make it through one more and will be okay.”</p>
          <p>“She’s a fighter alright,” the woman said.</p>

          <p>&emsp;Not long after I may have accidentally terrified the mother of a 15-month-old with my tale of partial deafness, a man brought an armful of groceries to my checkout lane.
          “How are you today?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Good,” he replied.</p>
          <p>“How are you doing with all of the craziness going on in the world right now?” I continued, turning to scan his first item. </p>
          <p>“I need to see your face,” the man said. I could now hear a slur in his speech. “I’m deaf.”</p>
          <p>&emsp;I was caught off guard, and found myself more than a tad embarrassed. For all of the difficulty I usually had hearing people while they were facing away from me, I had tried speaking to him with my face in an entirely different direction.</p>
          <p>“I’m deaf in my right ear,” I said, making sure to face him this time.</p>
          <p>“Oh,” the man said. He waited a beat, seemingly wondering if I would sign. I didn’t. It was not the first time that I kicked myself for never having learned sign language. The man just smiled. I fumbled with the man’s groceries as he ran his card through the scanner. He picked up his bags, smiled over his shoulder, and left.</p>

          <p>&emsp;	Two elderly women wheeled a cart down my checkout lane. They looked like two perfectly normal old ladies, aside from the fact that they were wearing perfectly matching outfits. Both sported white pants, a pink sweater with a green collared shirt underneath, matching short haircuts, and identical easter basket brooches on their left sides of their chests.</p>
          <p>“I love your outfits,” I said with a laugh. The women jumped at the comment.</p>

          <p>&emsp;For the second time during my time as a cashier, a guest forgot something in the bagging area. The first time, it had been the man who forgot his Amazon fire stick, but this customer had left something far more precious in the era of Coronavirus: a pack of toilet paper.</p>
          <p>“Excuse me one moment ma’m, I’m just going to try and catch that man before he leaves without his toilet paper." I tucked the pack under my arm and darted out the door. </p>
          <p>&emsp;I scanned the parking lot and, just when I was worried that I might have lost him, saw him pushing a cart towards the edge of the lot. I sprinted across the lot and offered him the pack of toilet paper.</p>
          <p>“Didn’t want you to forget this; it’s like gold nowadays,” I joked.</p>

          <p>“Well see, it is… And it just makes me so angry when some people say that the press is the enemy of the people. I take it as an insult to my father, and he served in Vietnam…” the man looked up, seemingly self-conscious of the political turn that he had taken. “Sorry about that…” he mumbled.</p>
          <p>“Oh no, you’re fine!” I exclaimed. I would have liked to ask the man more questions about his father or about his life during the pandemic, but unfortunately, as happens all too often, I had already bagged the last of his groceries.

          <p>&emsp;That Wednesday was my first day supervising self-checkout. There are four self-checkout machines, and because they’re self-checkout, my job mostly consists of helping people who are struggling to ring things up, fixing problems with the machines, and cleaning the stations between each customer. It was an eventful first day: a receipt printer ran out of paper, one of the cash dispensers stopped working, and a busy day of shoppers eager to avoid being around others meant plenty of traffic through self-checkout. I didn’t really interact with too many people; mostly just cleaned screens and issued often unreciprocated greetings and goodbyes.</p>
          <p>&emsp;An unforeseen side effect of working self-checkout was the objectifying comments that I occasionally received. I couldn’t quite figure out why this was a phenomenon that seemingly only existed in self checkout, though I’d guess that it’s a byproduct of being out from behind the counter and having to bend over to scrub down scanners. It wasn’t atrocious; just little comments that made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
          <p>&emsp;One older man eyed me up and down and kept calling me “cutie.” </p>
          <p>&emsp;Later, another older man walked up to me with three bananas. </p>
          <p>“Now I’m not too good with technology, and I don’t think that I’ll be able to ring these up on my own,” he said.</p>
          <p>“Well that’s alright, I’m more than happy to help!” I was particularly peppy, having just run out to the parking lot to make sure that another elderly man didn’t leave a bag that he had forgotten at the self-checkout station. (He had thanked me, and informed me that it was a toy for his grandson.) I walked the man with the bananas over to the station that I had just cleaned. I showed him how to click the produce button, select “bananas,” and change the number to 3.</p>
          <p>“Well that wasn’t too bad!” the man said. I smiled in response. </p>
          <p>“Now, I'm old, so I'm allowed to say this,” the man stated. “You are very attractive, and very helpful.” I was now also very uncomfortable. I smiled, wished the man a good day, and left to clean a different self-checkout register. </p>

          <p>“I just have this scooter!” she said, holding the box out towards me with a grin. </p>

          <p>“Whoops, I’m sorry ma'am, I don’t think that it scanned correctly. Would you mind if I tried again?” </p>
          <p>“Okay!!!” the woman replied, thrusting the scooter out towards me. By then, a second, older woman had approached and was standing beside the woman with the scooter. I tried to scan the barcode, but got another error message. The woman again pulled the scooter away.</p>
          <p>“I’m so sorry ma'am, but it’s giving me a little bit of trouble. Would you mind if I just look and see if there’s another barcode? Sometimes there are multiple barcodes on these bigger boxes.”</p>
          <p>“Okay!” the woman replied cheerily before promptly pivoting and walking in the other direction. </p>
          <p>“I’m so sorry,” the older woman said. “She has autism.” She turned and walked off towards the woman who I now assumed was her daughter, who was now talking to a different cashier. I just felt bad that the older woman had felt the need to apologize. Her daughter was the cheeriest person that I had met all day. </p>
          <p>Another customer came down my aisle, and I began ringing up their purchases. It would seem that the scooter barcode had been resolved by the other cashier, because the woman with the scooter walked back past my register and exclaimed, “have a great day, giiiirl!!!”</p>
          <p>“You too,” I said with a wave. I don’t think that she heard me. She had already marched towards the exit, her mother close behind. I hope that she enjoyed her scooter.</p>

          <p>“Well what else would I be buying this for?” he replied with a chuckle. His response threw me for a loop; nobody had ever challenged my rhetorical questions before.</p>
          <p>“Well, I guess that's a fair point.”</p>
          <p>“Actually, I was buying cat litter at another store, and the girl checking me out told me that if you have a dead body, you can hide it better with cat litter. But then, I suppose that this isn't enough to hide an entire body,” he said with a laugh. I wasn’t quite sure what response this warranted.</p>
          <p>“Well, let's hope that you never have to find out,” I joked.</p>
